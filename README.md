# Godot-Flecs

A basic demostration of how to integrate the [Flecs](https://www.flecs.dev/) [Entity Component System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system) as a Godot GDExtension.

The demo project is an implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).
